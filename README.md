# React-Jest-Enzyme

This is a practice to use jest-enzyme to test React components.

## Technologies Used

1. **React** (^16.3.2): an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.

2. **Redux** (^4.0.5): an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces.

3. **Jest** (^26.6.0): a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

4. **Enzyme** (^3.11.0): a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React Components' output.
